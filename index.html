            You are going to play a simple card game in which a player will be able to battle the autoplayer. 
            The game will deal 3 cards (each of which has a damage value) to the player and three cards to the 
            autoplayer. The player will choose a card, and the computer will randomly choose a card, and whichever's 
            card has the highest value will win the point. A round is finished once this has happened three times.
